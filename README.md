Project Overview: mufhua
mufhua is an Object Detection project designed to distinguish between Chihuahuas and Muffins, two objects that look surprisingly similar. The model identifies each object in an image by drawing a bounding box around it, providing coordinates (x, y, width, height), and labeling it as either a "Chihuahua" or a "Muffin."
